# JavaScript Accordion Website

This is a simple JavaScript Accordion website developed by me. The project showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive accordion component. Each section of the accordion can expand or collapse when clicked, revealing or hiding content.

## Features

- Clean and minimal design.
- Fully responsive for different screen sizes.
- Smooth animation for expanding and collapsing sections.
- Uses vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks).

## Technologies Used

- *HTML5*: For structuring the content.
- *CSS3*: For styling and layout.
- *JavaScript*: To handle accordion functionality and interactivity.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kosisochukwu-max/javascript-accordion.git
   
2. Open index.html in your browser to see the accordion in action.

## How the Accordion Works

- The accordion is built using vanilla JavaScript.
- Clicking on a section header expands that section, while collapsing others.
- CSS transitions are used to smoothly animate the opening and closing of the sections.

## Future Improvements

- Add more animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
- Improve accessibility features for keyboard navigation.
- Implement a dark mode toggle for better user accessibility.
